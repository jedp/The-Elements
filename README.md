# The Elements

The song by Tom Lehrer, with the periodic table humming along.  

My 7-year-old daughter has become obsessed with this song.  While she was at
school and I was home sick, I put this together to help us memorize the
complete lyrics.

This is attempt at using the audio API.  I've totally cribbed off of
[supersynth](https://github.com/davidgovea/supersynth).
